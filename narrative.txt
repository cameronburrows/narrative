Coming into this class I was not sure what to expect. I was hopeful to learn about simple coding techniques and methods but besides that I was not really sure what else this class would do for me. In the beginning of the semester I set a couple goals for myself, the first being simply to understand how to code and learn the basic functions of python, build my own game and come away with something valuable from this class. I do believe I have grasped the basics of code through lectures as well as different coding websites. Although I did attempt to replicate as well as create my own game I ultimately failed, I wanted to replicate the offline game in chrome, The Dino Game but found myself with many setbacks. I instead ended up following a tutorial that helped me build it alongside ursina. I do think that I have come away with some valuable knowledge from this class but to be completely honest I do not think that coding is for me, I wouldn’t necessarily contribute that to this class, for me it just wasn’t something I truly enjoyed. In terms of what I accomplished I was able to learn how to establish coding environments as well as setup certain functions and learn the true infinite capabilities of code. Along with the lecture videos I followed tutorials on free code as well as having Charlie Pilc help me. I would say my time out of class tended to vary some weeks I’d spend 2-3 hours but some only 30 minutes. I do believe I should’ve applied myself more to this class because I do think that I could’ve taken more away from it had I done so. My goals in a sense devolved through the semester and in reflection I don't believe they were unattainable but I should have applied myself more if I truly wanted to achieve. I think I was successful in
